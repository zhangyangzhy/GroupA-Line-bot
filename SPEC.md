| Summaries of News                    | The main objective of this section is to design and implementation of summaries of news, which include two functions. One is the least news from the Internet. When users send the news keyword, the chatbot will send some news at present back to users. Another is the top 5 news among all the news, which have been read recently. That is to say after reading the news, the chatbot will count the reading time. When we send the chatbot with hottest keyword, it will return us the top 5 news according to the recent reading records.                                                                   | WU Peicong |
| The Measurement Against Coronavirus  | This part of function is aiming to give people some information of measurements against Coronavirus. The chat bot may have tree features. 1. If user send one question or just one keyword to the bot, it will be able to search in the database and provide a related answer. For example. If user send "How do people measure the Coronavirus?" or "Measurement", etc, the chat bot will search related records in redis and reply the related information. 2. The bot will remember how many times each answer used and provide a rank list. 3. If user send a voice message to the bot, it is able to reply it. | LI Jinhui  |
