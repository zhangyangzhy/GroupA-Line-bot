| Summaries of News  | The main objective of this section is to design and implementation of summaries of news, which include two functions. One is the least news from the Internet. When users send the news keyword, the chatbot will send some news at present back to users. Another is the top 5 news among all the news, which have been read recently. That is to say after reading the news, the chatbot will count the reading time. When we send the chatbot with hottest keyword, it will return us the top 5 news according to the recent reading records. | WU Peicong |
